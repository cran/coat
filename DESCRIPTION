Description: Agreement of continuously scaled measurements made by two techniques, devices or methods is usually
             evaluated by the well-established Bland-Altman analysis or plot. Conditional method agreement trees (COAT),
             proposed by Karapetyan, Zeileis, Henriksen, and Hapfelmeier (2025) <doi:10.1093/jrsssc/qlae077>,
             embed the Bland-Altman analysis in the framework of recursive partitioning to explore heterogeneous method
             agreement in dependence of covariates. COAT can also be used to perform a Bland-Altman test for differences
             in method agreement.
